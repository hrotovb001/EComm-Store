# EComm My Store

## How To Build and Run

1. First, clone the repo to your local machine
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CommanderChrisOrg/CommanderChris.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project's root directory
    ```bash
    cd EComm-Store
    ```

3. Run the project
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

This should install the necessary dependencies to run the app, then start the app. If a browser tab with the locally hosted site is not opened automatically, you can copy one of the addresses in the terminal response to do so.
